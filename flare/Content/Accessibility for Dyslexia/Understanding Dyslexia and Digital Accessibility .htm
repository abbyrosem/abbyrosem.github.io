        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/exercise3final.png" style="float: left;left: 10px;top: 87px;width: 312px;height: 309px;" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { position: absolute;z-index: 0; }" />Try to envision clicking on a web page and being bombarded with messy fonts, illegible text, and perplexing designs. For millions of people living with dyslexia, it's a reality every day. Digital accessibility isn't a nice-to-have; it's a need-to-have to make spaces where everyone can read, learn, and connect.</p>
        <p>Dyslexia is a common learning difference that can make reading, spelling, and language processing difficult. Some 15–20% of the population is affected to varying degrees (International Dyslexia Association). Within digital realms—such as websites, apps, or e-books—the issues can be even more significant, especially since many designs do not take these readers into account.</p>
        <p>People with dyslexia struggle with hard-to-read fonts, poor color contrast, excessive blocks of text, and confusing layout (British Dyslexia Association). All can be challenging to use with digital content. Since much of what we do today is done online, it is more critical than ever that we design websites, books, and data products that are accessible to all, including individuals with dyslexia.</p>
        <p>This is especially true in industries that involve publishing and data analysis. Publishers need to think about what their text looks like and how easy it is to navigate through their electronic content. Data analysts also need to consider how they present information, so that charts and dashboards are clear and not overly complicated. It's not always about following guidelines like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018) — it's about being inclusive and ensuring everyone has an equal chance to access information.</p>
        <p>As we make online content more accessible to people with dyslexia, we're actually improving the experience for a much wider group overall. Simple adjustments, such as using dyslexia-friendly fonts, clear headings, and keeping sites simple, can have a considerable effect. Accessibility must be a priority from the start, not an afterthought.</p>
