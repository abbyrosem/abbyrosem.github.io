        <p>Hi, I’m Abby Malakoff — a writer, data analyst, and aspiring book publisher currently completing my senior year at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm majoring in English and Business, with a focus in Professional Writing and Technical Communication.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>My academic and creative interests center around storytelling, data-driven decision making, and accessibility in publishing. I’m particularly passionate about using analytics to improve reader engagement and create inclusive content experiences.</p>
        <p>Outside the classroom, I’ve worked on editorial teams, built digital portfolios, and created visual work in a number of Adobe platforms. This website was made with MadCap Flare and I also created another website fully coded by me using HTML/CSS that will showcase my creative writing, academic projects, and software skills.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and hope to eventually launch my own publishing company: one that’s innovative, inclusive, and reader-focused.</p>
