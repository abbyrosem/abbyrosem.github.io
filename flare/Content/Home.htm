                <p>This website explores accessibility in digital content, with a focus on supporting individuals with dyslexia. You’ll find research on the basics and historical context of accessibility, practical guides for creating inclusive content in publishing and data analysis, and tools for applying these ideas in platforms like InDesign, Excel, and Tableau. I’ve also included a custom video that dives into accessibility features in Unity, showing how these concepts apply in interactive design as well. Whether you're new to accessibility or looking to improve your design practices, there’s something here for you.</p>

                <h1 style="color: #ffc0cb;">Why This Topic Interests Me</h1>
                <p>As someone who’s passionate about both publishing and data, I’ve been thinking a lot about how accessibility can—and should—be built into the way we share information. Dyslexia affects millions of readers, and yet it's often overlooked in digital design. I chose this topic because I want to help bridge that gap by learning how to create content that’s not only functional but also inclusive. Combining creativity, usability, and empathy is what drives my interest in this work.</p>
