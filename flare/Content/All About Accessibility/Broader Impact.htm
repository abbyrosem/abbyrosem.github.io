        <h1 style="color: #000000;">The Broader Impact of Accessibility</h1>
        <p>Making digital content accessible is not just about compliance but also for business. Studies show that accessible websites rank better in search engines, leading to increased visibility (Jones 112). Additionally, with over one billion people worldwide living with disabilities, accessible design opens up products and services to a much broader audience (World Health Organization 34).</p>
        <p>Accessible design benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities. Kalbag explains that ‘good accessibility practices lead to better usability for all users, improving readability, navigation, and overall experience’ (Kalbag 67).</p>
