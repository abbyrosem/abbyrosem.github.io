        <h1 style="color: #000000;">Historical and Legal Context of Accessibility </h1>
        <p>In order to fully understand Accessibility it is important to consider the historical barriers it has once faced and how far it has come. Digital accessibility has come a long way, thanks to key laws that have shaped how we create and use technology. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, specifically Section 508, requires federal agencies to ensure their electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. This means that the government's websites, software, and other digital tools must be designed so that everyone, regardless of ability, can use them effectively. (section508.gov)</p>
        <p>Across the Atlantic, the European Union introduced the Web Accessibility Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/2102) to ensure public sector websites and mobile applications are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This directive mandates that EU member states implement national legislation conforming to its standards, aiming to make digital services accessible to the 80 million people with disabilities in the EU. The directive addresses websites and apps of public sector organizations, refers to specific standards such as EN 301 549, requires the publication of an accessibility statement, calls for a feedback mechanism for users to flag accessibility problems, and expects regular accessibility monitoring and corresponding public reports by member states.</p>
        <p>These laws highlight a global commitment to inclusive digital spaces, ensuring everyone has equal access to information and services online.</p>
