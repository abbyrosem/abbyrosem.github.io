                <h2>Project One; Grant Proposal</h2>
                <p>A 6,000-word grant proposal was written on behalf of a non-profit organization. This differed from anything I had written before, so it expanded my writing capabilities immensely.

                <h2>Project Two; Microsoft Word Manual</h2>
                <p>I wrote this word manual in the Fall semester of my senior year. It is written to help business students explicitly use the Word Platform for their business classes in college. Writing this manual cemented my knowledge of Microsoft Word.</p>

                <h2>Project Three; Rhetorical Analysis</h2>
                <p>I wrote this rhetorical analysis for my English 494SI class as a junior. I believe this piece of writing represents how far I have come as a writer because I pushed myself to engage with environmental issues, scientific or political problems, and deep human crises.</p>

                <h2>Project Four; In-Design Book</h2>
                <p>Adobe InDesign is a professional-grade desktop publishing software used to create and lay out page designs for print and digital publications like magazines, books, brochures, etc. The chapbook I created showcases several pieces of my creative writing work connecting it with art I love and feel passionate about. I included the link to the cover of the book as well as the contents.</p>
