                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Abby Malakoff — a writer, data analyst, and aspiring book publisher, currently finishing my senior year at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm majoring in English with a minor in Business and a focus on Professional Writing and Technical Communication.</p>
        
                <p>My work lives at the intersection of storytelling, data-driven decision making, and accessibility in publishing. I’m especially passionate about using analytics to improve reader engagement and create content experiences that are inclusive, innovative, and meaningful.</p>
        
                <p>Outside the classroom, I’ve contributed to editorial teams, built interactive digital portfolios, and developed visual projects using various Adobe platforms. I’m also in the process of creating this website — an imaginative space to share my writing, academic work, and digital tools.</p>
        
                <p>When I’m not writing or designing, you’ll probably find me reading literary fiction, exploring cozy coffee shops, or planning my next creative side project. I also enjoy fitness and wellness (especially weightlifting), traveling, and discovering new music playlists to soundtrack my work sessions.</p>
        
                <p>Looking ahead, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and want to eventually launch my own publishing company — one that prioritizes innovation, accessibility, and the evolving ways people connect with stories.</p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This portfolio website was designed and built from scratch using HTML and CSS to showcase my writing, design, and technical communication work. It reflects the skills I’ve developed in web development, digital design, and accessible content creation as part of my coursework in the Professional Writing and Technical Communication program at UMass Amherst.</p>
        <p>I focused on creating a clean, responsive layout with purposeful use of color, typography, and navigation to highlight both creative and software-based projects. I also integrated accessible design features to ensure usability for a wide range of users.</p>
        <p>Some of the projects featured here — including my MadCap Flare website and Adobe Illustrator design work — represent my interest in blending visual storytelling with technical precision. Building this site deepened my skills in front-end development, project organization, and user-centered design.</p>
