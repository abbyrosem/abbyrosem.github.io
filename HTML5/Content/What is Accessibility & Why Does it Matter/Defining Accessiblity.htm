        <h1>Defining Accessibility </h1>
        <p>Digital accessibility ensures that digital content and technologies are designed to be usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. This encompasses considerations for various impairments, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines web accessibility as ensuring that "websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them" ("Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)"). The goal is to remove barriers that might prevent interaction with or access to digital platforms, thereby promoting inclusivity and equal access to information. For instance, designing websites with proper HTML structure, providing textual alternatives for images, and ensuring keyboard navigability are essential practices that enhance accessibility ("Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview"). These measures not only assist users with disabilities but also improve the overall user experience for everyone.</p>
