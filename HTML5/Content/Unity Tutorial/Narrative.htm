        <h1>Narrative</h1>
        <p><b>What is Unity?</b> Unity is a collaborative research computing platform that provides academic researchers and industry partners with powerful computing resources and support. It enables users to manage data, conduct high-performance computing tasks, and collaborate efficiently. In this tutorial, I walk through the Unity OnDemand File Browser, demonstrating key storage options and best practices for file management.</p>
        <p><b>What did this project involve? </b>This project involved creating a short, informative video tutorial to help users navigate the Unity OnDemand File Browser. Over the course of two weeks, I worked closely with technical writer Lauren Saloio to translate written documentation into an engaging, accessible video.</p>
        <p><b>Key Skills and Tools Used:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Technical Communication: Adapted complex documentation into an easy-to-follow video format.</p>
        <p>Screen Capture &amp; Editing: Used SharePoint Stream and Clipchamp to record and edit the tutorial.</p>
        <p>Accessibility &amp; Transcripts: Edited auto-generated transcripts to ensure clarity and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Independent Learning &amp; Initiative: Researched additional storage details and best practices beyond the provided documentation.</p>
        <p>Collaboration: Engaged with Lauren Saloio and peers to ensure accuracy and completeness.</p>
        <p><b>Key Learnings:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Storage Management: I gained insight into different storage options on Unity and best practices for data persistence.</p>
        <p>Video Production: I improved skills in scriptwriting, screen recording, and narration.</p>
        <p>Accessibility Considerations: I understood the importance of accurate transcripts and closed captions for inclusive content.</p>
        <p><b>The Importance of Transcripts and Closed Captions</b>
        </p>
        <p>Transcripts and closed captions enhance accessibility by making video content usable for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. They also aid comprehension for non-native speakers and improve search-ability. By ensuring my tutorial includes an accurate transcript, I hope to be contributing to a more inclusive learning environment.</p>
